## Technical Approach
#### 1.OOP Concepts:
Object Oriented Programming Concepts will be Used to make the System more Maintainable more Modular. So that it can be changed to any needs of the consumer if necessary and to be able to maintain the  System. OOP principles that will be used are:
Class : To describe the behavior of an object. Its functionality and limitation.
Object : To interact and use different functionality of the system at runtime.
Inheritance : To maintain a Hairacy of class and objects to make them more maintainable and modular.
Polymorphism : To make sure same action can be done in different ways to make the system more robust .
Abstraction : To hide internal detail of a class.
Encapsulation : To bind certain functionality to a specific users.
